    variables:
      area:
        title: 'Arable land'
        unit: 'hectares'
        short_unit: 'ha'
        description: |
          Arable land is the total of areas (extent of surface of land or water) under temporary crops, temporary meadows and pastures, and land with temporary fallow.  Arable land does not include land that is potentially cultivable but is not normally cultivated.
      index:
        title: 'Gross Production Index Number'
        unit: ''
        short_unit: ''
        description: |
          Gross Production Index Number (2014-2016 = 100).

        unit: ''
        short_unit: ''
        description: |
          Index of arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops (where values in 1961 are equal to 1.0). This is calculated as arable land divided by the crop production index (PIN). The crop production index here is the sum of crop commodities produced (after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed). It is weighted by the commodity prices.

          This metric measures the index of arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops (where values in 1961 are equal to 1.0).

          Arable land is the total of areas (extent of surface of land or water) under temporary crops, temporary meadows and pastures, and land with temporary fallow.  Arable land does not include land that is potentially cultivable but is not normally cultivated.

    variables:
      sustainable_fish:
        title: "Percentage of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels"
        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
      overexploited_fish:
        title : "Percentage of overexploited fish stocks"
        unit: "%"

  land_spared_by_increased_crop_yields:
    variables:
      area:
        title: "Actual cropland area today"
        unit: "hectares"
        short_unit: "ha"
        description: |
          Total cropland area on a given year, calculated by dividing the total production by the crop yield.
      area_with_yield_of_1961:
        title: "Cropland area needed if yields stagnated in 1961"
        unit: "hectares"
        short_unit: "ha"
        description: |
          Total cropland area that would be necessary if crop yields stagnated in 1961.
          
          This area is calculated by dividing the total production on a given year by the crop yield of 1961.
      spared_land:
        title: "Land spared due to crop yield increases"
        unit: "hectares"
        short_unit: "ha"
        description: |
          Land spared since 1961 due to the increase of crop yields.

          This area is calculated as the cropland area that would be necessary if crop yields stagnated in 1961, minus the true cropland area on a given year.
      spared_land__pct:
        title: "Percentage reduction in area needed due to crop yield increases"
        unit: "hectares"
        short_unit: "ha"
        description: |
          Land spared since 1961 due to the increase of crop yields, as a percentage of the total land that would be necessary if crop yields had not increased since then.
