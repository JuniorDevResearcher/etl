          Arable land is the total of areas (extent of surface of land or water) under temporary crops, temporary meadows and pastures, and land with temporary fallow.  Arable land does not include land that is potentially cultivable but is not normally cultivated.

        description: |
          Index of arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops (where values in 1961 are equal to 1.0). This is calculated as arable land divided by the crop production index (PIN). The crop production index here is the sum of crop commodities produced (after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed). It is weighted by the commodity prices.

          This metric measures the index of arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops (where values in 1961 are equal to 1.0).

          Arable land is the total of areas (extent of surface of land or water) under temporary crops, temporary meadows and pastures, and land with temporary fallow.  Arable land does not include land that is potentially cultivable but is not normally cultivated.
