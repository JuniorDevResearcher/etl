          The number of reported cases of guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis) as reported by the WHO.


          The WHO defines a case of guinea worm disease as the following:


          "A case of guinea-worm disease is a person exhibiting a skin lesion with emergence of a Guinea worm, and in which
          the worm is confirmed in laboratory tests to be Dracunculus medinensis. That person is counted as a case only once
          during the calendar year, i.e. when the first worm emerges from that person. All worm specimens should be obtained
          from each case patient for laboratory confirmation and sent to the United States Centers for Disease Control and
          Prevention (CDC). All cases should be monitored at least twice per month during the remainder of the calendar year
          for prompt detection of possible emergence of additional guinea worms."
